Hello, if you are stuck and don't know where to place everything, here you go (Do all of this on the Udoo)

First download this zip and extract it to the desktop. There should be a file called Udoo.py, place it on the desktop for now.
Second grab the Udoo-Lib folder and place it in /home/ubuntu/Arduino/libraries/ folder
Third and last open up Arduino, go to file -> examples -> Udoo -> Debug, Flash it to the Udoo, then run the Udoo.py script to see if it printed anything

Thanks, David

Please report any bugs to me
